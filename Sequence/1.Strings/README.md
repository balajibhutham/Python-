A brief description of what this project does and who it's for

## Strings
       1. Any sequence of characters within either single quotes or double quotes is considered as a String
       2. Python strings are "immutable" which means they cannot be changed after they are created.
       3. A string in Python is an object of the str class. 
## Indexing and slicing

Indexing:

       Indexing is used for the selection of a  single element.

       Positive indexing starts from 0.

       Negative Indexing starts from -1.

       Index returns one item

       To retrieve an element of the sequence(list,tuple etc, we use the index operator ([]):
           
       
Slicing: 
          
          Slicing is used for the selection of multiple elements.

          In Python, you perform slicing using the colon: operator.
          
          When we assign a single element to slicing, we get a TypeError. It will only accept iterables.


## Built-in Functions 

       some of the built-in functions are :
                         1. index
                         2. copy
                         3. len
                         4. count
                         5. split
                         6. strip
                         7. join
                         8. find
                         9. replace
                         10. starts with
                         11. ends with
